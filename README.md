# ece510 projects

My solutions for the projects of [ECE 510 - Foundations in Computer Engineering](https://ece.umass.edu/sites/default/files/ece510-syllabus-full.docx) in UMass Amherst.

+ **[Project 1: Elevator Operation](https://github.com/zhang-guodong/ece510-projects/tree/master/Project%201%20Elevator%20Operation)**

  + AKA **Finite State Machines in Verilog**. This assignment will give you experience in Verilog by implementing a Finite State Machine using of a simplified elevator operation. It will also expose you to buffering and serialization when multiple elevator buttons are pressed simultaneously.

+ **[Project 2: C++ Programming](https://github.com/zhang-guodong/ece510-projects/tree/master/Project%202%20C%2B%2B%20Programming)**

  + The goal of this project is to practice elementary concepts in C++ programming.

+ **[Project 3: MIPS Simulator](https://github.com/zhang-guodong/ece510-projects/tree/master/Project%203%20MIPS%20Simulator)**

  + This assignment will give you experience in programming in C++ and the operation of a MIPS pipelined processor. Further, you will gain insight into how multiple events that occur in parallel can be simulated using a sequential machine.
