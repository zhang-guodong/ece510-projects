### ECE 510: Foundations of Computer Engineering
### Project 2: C++ Programming

The goal of this project is to practice elementary concepts in C++ programming.

[1] Write a C++ program that generates a random integer and checks if the random integer generated is greater than 100.

[2] Figure out a way to measure the execution time of a particular code in C++ and use this approach to time the program written in question [1].

[3] Write a C++ program that creates two arrays of the same size. Initialize one of them with zeros and one with random integers. Write a function to find the largest current value in the populated array. The function should replace that value with zero and return it. Upon return, the first location in the initially unpopulated array should be replaced with the value returned by the function. Implement these actions in a loop until all values have been transferred. Determine the time required to execute the program for array sizes of 10, 100, 1000 and 10000. Include screenshots of program running.

[4] What is the complexity of the program? Explain your answer.

**Make sure to submit the code, necessary screenshots and a brief write up that describes your code for questions [1] and [3].**
